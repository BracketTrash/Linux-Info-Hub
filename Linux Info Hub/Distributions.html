                                    A default installation of Ubuntu contains a wide range of software that includes LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird, Transmission, and several lightweight games such as Sudoku and chess. Many additional software packages are accessible from the built in Ubuntu Software, previously Ubuntu Software Center, as well as any other APT-based package management tools.
                                    Many additional software packages that are no longer installed by default, such as Evolution, GIMP, Pidgin, and Synaptic, are still accessible in the repositories still installable by the main tool or by any other APT-based package management tool. Cross-distribution snap packages and flatpaks are also available, that both allow installing software, such as some of Microsoft's software, in most of the major Linux operating systems (such as any currently supported Ubuntu version and in Fedora). The default file manager is GNOME Files, formerly called Nautilus.

For the Ubuntu desktop release 16.04 LTS, a PC with at least 2 GHz dual-core processor, 2 GB of RAM and 25 GB of free disk space is recommended. For less powerful computers, there are other Ubuntu distributions such as Lubuntu and Xubuntu. Ubuntu supports the ARM architecture.It is also available on Power,while older PowerPC architecture was at one point unofficially supported, and now newer Power Architecture CPUs are supported.

                                    Pacman is to Arch, as APT is to Debian and emerge is to Gentoo. Used from a terminal, it is a single command that downloads and installs the latest version of most programs the average user needs.<br>

                                    Fedora has a reputation for focusing on innovation, integrating new technologies early on and working closely with upstream Linux communities. Making changes upstream instead of specifically for Fedora ensures that the changes are available to all Linux distributions.  Fedora has a relatively short life cycle: each version is usually supported for at least 13 months, where version X is supported only until 1 month after version X+2 is released and with approximately 6 months between most versions. Fedora users can upgrade from version to version without reinstalling.<br><br>

                                    The default desktop environment in Fedora is GNOME and the default user interface is the GNOME Shell. Other desktop environments, including KDE Plasma, Xfce, LXDE, MATE and Cinnamon, are available and can be installed.<br>

                                    Manjaro Linux comes with both a CLI and a graphical installer. The rolling release model means that the user does not need to reinstall the whole system to keep it all up-to-date inline with the latest release. Package management is handled by pacman via command line (terminal), and frontend GUI package manager tools called Pamac (for its Xfce edition) & Octopi (for its KDE edition). It can be configured to be either a stable system (default) or bleeding edge in line with Arch.<br><br>

                                    The repositories are managed with their own tool called BoxIt, which is designed like git. Manjaro includes its own GUI settings manager where options like language, drivers and kernel version can be simply configured.<br><br>

                                    Certain commonly used Arch utilities such as the Arch Build System (ABS) are available but have alternate implementations in Manjaro. Manjaro Xfce is delivered with the Manjaro's own dark theme as well as the Xfce desktop.<br><br>

                                    Manjaro KDE is delivered with the Manjaro's own dark KDE Theme as well as the current KDE Plasma, KDE Apps, and the KDE Framework. Manjaro GNOME became the third official version with the Gellivara release and offers the GNOME desktop along with a version of the Manjaro theme.<br><br>

                                    Manjaro Architect is a CLI net installer which allows the user to choose their own kernel version, drivers and desktop environment during the install process. Both the official and the community edition's desktop environments are available for selection. While not official releases, Manjaro Community Editions are maintained by members of the Manjaro Team. They offer additional user interfaces over the official releases, including Budgie, Cinnamon, Deepin, i3, LXDE and MATE.

The third core developer Raphaël Hertzog joined them as a Debian expert. Kali Linux is based on Debian Testing. Most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian repositories. Kali Linux is developed using a secure environment with only a small number of trusted people that are allowed to commit packages. Each package being digitally signed by the developer. Kali also has a custom-built kernel that is patched for 802.11 wireless injection. This was added because the development team found they needed to do a lot of wireless assessments.

                                    1. Kali Linux is distributed in 32-bit and 64-bit images for use on hosts based on the x86 instruction set and as an image for the ARM architecture for use on the Beagle Board computer and on Samsung's ARM Chromebook. The developers of Kali Linux aim to make Kali Linux available for even more ARM devices.<br>
                                    Kali Linux is already available for BeagleBone Black, HP Chromebook, CubieBoard 2, CuBox, CuBox-i, Raspberry Pi, EfikaMX, Odroid U2, Odroid XU, Odroid XU3, Samsung Chromebook, Utilite Pro, Galaxy Note 10.1, and SS808. With the arrival of Kali NetHunter, Kali Linux is also officially available on Android devices such as the Nexus 5, Nexus 6, Nexus 7, Nexus 9, Nexus 10, OnePlus One, and some Samsung Galaxy models. Kali Linux is available on Windows 10, on top of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The official Kali distribution for Windows can be downloaded from the Microsoft Store.<br><br>

                                    2.This Kali Linux is openly sourced system and can be easily accessed by the users. All the codes in the Kali Linux can be viewed easily by the anyone and the open development tree makes easy to view the development of coding at every step.<br><br>
                                    3.As the Kali Linux has all the Penetration’ tools in the English language, but other than that it allows users to work in numerous languages and get the comfort of their local language.

                                    Gentoo appeals to Linux users who want full control of the software that is installed and running on their computer. People who are prepared to invest the time required to configure and tune a Gentoo system can build very efficient desktops and servers. Gentoo encourages users to build a Linux kernel tailored to their particular hardware. It allows very fine control of which services are installed and running; also, memory usage can be reduced, compared to other distributions, by omitting unnecessary kernel features and services.<br><br>

                                    A very large collection of software is available. Each package contains details of any dependencies on other software, so only the minimum set need be installed to run the required applications. Optional features of individual packages, for example whether they require LDAP support, can be selected by the user and any resulting package requirements are automatically included in the set of dependencies.<br><br>

                                    As Gentoo does not impose a standard look and feel, installed packages usually appear as their authors intended.<br>

                                    Gentoo may be installed in several ways. The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage3 tarball (explained below). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distribution's Live CD, Live USB or Network Booting using the "Gentoo Alternative Install Guide". A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.<br><br>

                                    Previously, Gentoo supported installation from stage1 and stage2 tarballs; however, the Gentoo Foundation no longer recommends them. Stage1 and stage2 are meant only for Gentoo developers.<br><br>

                                    Stage1 begins with only what is necessary to build a toolchain (the various compilers, linkers, and language libraries necessary to compile other software) for the target system; compiling this target toolchain from another, pre-existing host system is known as bootstrapping the target system.<br><br>

                                    Stage2 begins with a self-hosting (bootstrapped) toolchain for the target system, which is then used to compile all other core userland software for the target.<br><br>

                                    Stage3 begins with a minimal set of compiled user software, with which the kernel and any other additional software are then configured and compiled.

                                    1. In June 2018 the Gentoo GitHub code repository mirror used mainly by developers was hacked after an attacker gained access to a Gentoo Github organization administrator's account via deducing the password. Gentoo promptly responded by containing the attack and improving security practices.<br><br>

                                    2.Upon launch, Gentoo quickly became a popular distribution, with 326 hits per day on average in 2002 on DistroWatch.com – the third highest. However, over the years Gentoo has suffered from a dropping popularity.<br><br>

                                    In 2003, Gentoo was the fourth most popular and dropped to seventh in 2004, ninth in 2005, tenth in 2006 and thirteenth in 2007. For 2008, Gentoo dropped to 18th, but the following year it ended its dropping streak by rising to 17th. Gentoo was placed 18th in 2010, 20th in 2011, 22nd in 2012, 33rd in 2013, 38th in 2014, and 45th in 2015. In 2016 it became slightly more popular, climbing back up to 35th place, but has since fallen to 41st.<br><br>

                                    3.Portage is Gentoo's software distribution and package management system. The original design was based on the ports system used by the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) based operating systems. The portage tree contains over 19,000 packages ready for installation in a Gentoo system.
