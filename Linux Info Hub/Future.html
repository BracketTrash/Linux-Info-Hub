                        Linux currently does very well in servers, and in mid-end embedded application roles, espically ones that d lots of networking. Neither of these roles seem to be changing anytime soon.<br><br>

                        One area where Linux is constantly improving is in "low-end" embedded systems. Linux has not done well here as these systems are too resource constrained. "Low-end" is slowing marching up the line. It has gone from 8-bit CPU's, to 16-bit, and now 32-bit.  As this march continues, Linux will have an increasingly easier time on these systems. https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-future-of-Linux.<br><br>

                        Apple and Microsoft oth deploy different versions of their operating systems on different platforms. Apple has IOS fro the "low-end" and OS X for the "High-end", whereas Microsoft has Windows CE for the "Low-end" and Windows Desktop for the "High-end". Linux has neer had that. This is why it has one very well in the embedded space. It never had to be cut-down for the "Low-end". It always had full features because "High-end" features end up perlocating down.<br><br>

                        Linux also shows signs of becoming the leading operating system for gaming.  Each year, support for more and more games is being added, with the gaming giant, Valve, leading the charge by constantly optimizing their own titles as well as their Steam Client, 2which is currently the worlds biggest marketplace for games.  Valve made the decision to improve their Linux support as the release of Windows 8 made Microsift's OS even more closed off.
